# H-M-Personalized-Fashion-Recommendations
##  H&M’s online store offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. But with too many choices, customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are essential.
Hence, the task is “Given previous transactions, customer & product metadata including product description and image, recommend 12 products that are relevant for customer”. Since we need to sort/rank the 12 most relevant products, we might approach this problem as a ranking or classification problem.
Participants were allowed to freely choose the data they want to use either only historical transactions or product description text or even product images. The solution is not restricted to specific algorithms. We were only expected to generate the top 12 relevant products for customers, then later will be evaluated by the same metric: Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12).
